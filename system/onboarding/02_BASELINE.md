# Onboarding Step 2: Your Current Baseline

**Goal:** Generate `My_Foundation/My_Baseline.md`
**Prerequisite:** `My_Foundation/My_Journey_Context.md` must exist (Step 1 completed)
**Estimated time:** 15-20 minutes
**Next step:** Step 3 — Your Vision (say "continue setup" or "next step")

## Instructions for Claude

Before starting, read `My_Foundation/My_Journey_Context.md` for context.

Open with something like:
"Now let's take an honest snapshot of where you are right now. Not where you want to be — where you actually are. This becomes your reference point so we can track real change over time."

## Domain Assessment

For each domain below, ask the user to rate themselves 1-10 and explain briefly. Skip domains that clearly don't apply.

### Identity & Self-Concept
- How do you see yourself right now? What's the core belief you operate from?
- Are you living at your capacity or below it? By how much?

### Emotional Regulation
- How do you handle stress, conflict, and triggers?
- Do you have a "delay system" (ability to pause before reacting)?
- What still gets to you?

### Professional / Financial
- Where are you at with work/career/business?
- Relationship with money — earning, spending, receiving?

### Health & Body
- Physical state — energy, sleep, exercise, diet?
- Anything your body is telling you that you're ignoring?

### Social & Community
- Do you have genuine friendships? How many?
- Do you feel isolated or connected?

### Relationships & Intimacy
- Current relationship status and satisfaction?
- Patterns in how you choose partners or avoid choosing?

### Creativity & Expression
- Are you creating anything? Making anything? Playing anything?

## Operating Patterns
- Do you notice cycles? (Bursts of productivity followed by crashes, for example)
- What's your most reliable form of self-sabotage?
- What are you avoiding right now that you know you need to face?

## Strengths & Resources
- What ARE you good at? What do people come to you for?
- What practices or habits are already working?

## When Complete

1. Summarize into structured assessment. Read it back. Ask: "Anything feel off or missing?"

2. Once confirmed, generate `My_Foundation/My_Baseline.md`:

```markdown

3. Tell the user: "Step 2 is done — your baseline is saved. Whenever you're ready for Step 3, just say 'continue setup' or 'next step' and we'll build your vision."

## Constraints
- Warm, direct tone. Follow their energy — some domains resonate more.
- Ratings are for self-awareness, not judgment.
- Never judge or diagnose.
